If you have not yet create it, you might want to check out the quick start with Hexo, otherwise let’s go through a few essential plugins that might leverage your blog’s usability very briefly. You can find the detailed list of plugins here. Comments &amp; DiscussionsOne of the most important features of a blog is perhaps the possiblity to interact with your readers and that will keep them coming back. disqus is a popular commenting service that works through the javascript snippet within your page. What you need to do to modify your blog with a full fledged commenting service is to sign up for a disqus account, register your site and pick a unique shortname for your blog and paste it in your _config.yaml file, right below your theme name as shown here. 1disqus_shortname: &lt;your-disqus-shortname&gt; Blog SearchUsing this plugin, you can empower your blog reader with the ability of searching through your posts. 1$ npm install hexo-generator-json-content --save Right after installation, the plugin should work properly out of the box (after running hexo generate or hexo server). however, in order to through details of configuration you might want to check its github page or your theme’s “_config.yaml” file. RSS FeedYou can enable your blog with an RSS feed out of your posts in hexo by installing this plugin. 1$ npm install hexo-generator-feed --save The plugin can be configured in the _config.yaml with the following configuration section. 1234feed: type: atom path: atom.xml limit: 20 Markdown SupportThis plugin provides more support on the markdown such as gmf (Github flavored markdown) tables and line breaks. 1$ npm install hexo-renderer-marked --save You can customize the plugin by pasting the following in your _config.yaml and changing the values. 12345678marked: gfm: true pedantic: false sanitize: false tables: true breaks: true smartLists: true smartypants: true Category GeneratorThis plugin allows you to assign one or more tags to your post. It will group your posts and enables your readers to later on find out about all of posts that are tagged with the same category. 1$ npm install hexo-generator-category --save and the related options are as follows: 12category_generator: per_page: 10 CNAME GeneratorThis plugin will automatically generate a Github pages CNAME file. 1$ npm install hexo-generator-cname --save This plugin does not require any specific configuration. Only make sure to change your blog’s url to the real one in the _config.yaml 123# URL## If your site is put in a subdirectory, set url as 'http://yoursite.com/child' and root as '/child/'url: &lt;real-blog-url&gt; Git DeployerThis plugin will help you deploy your blog using git. 1$ npm install hexo-deployer-git --save You can configure the deployer plugin like this: 1234deploy: type: git repo: https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository&gt; branch: master Deploy to GithubWhen you are ready to deploy your blog to the github, run the following commands to generate your blog and deploy it to the specified branch in your github repository as you setup before. 12$ hexo generate$ hexo deploy Now that you have your generated blog on github, you can configure and connect your custom domain to load your blog from github.","categories":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Hexo/"},{"name":"Plugins","slug":"Hexo/Plugins","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Hexo/Plugins/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Tutorials","slug":"Tutorials","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Tutorials/"},{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Blogging/"},{"name":"StaticWebsite","slug":"StaticWebsite","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/StaticWebsite/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Hexo/"},{"name":"Plugins","slug":"Hexo/Plugins","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Hexo/Plugins/"}]},{"title":"Creating a Blog by Hexo","slug":"2016/hexo-quick-start","date":"2016-07-14T19:55:50.000Z","updated":"2016-08-28T14:37:46.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/hexo-quick-start/","link":"","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/2016/hexo-quick-start/","excerpt":"Have you ever wished you could create your own blog in no time?

Did you get frustrated as you thought you might not have enough time to design and set it up? Do you also wish to have more control over your blog comparing to other blogs such as those in Wordpress? Well, that was exactly the case for me and if it’s the same for you, then give “static site generators” a go. What is a “Static Stite Generator”?In short, a static site generator is basically a html file generator. It crates and formats html files by using its template engine as well as your text which is usually in a format such as markdown. Static site generators are very much easy to setup and use while providing users with more control over it. You can choose and heavily customize themes, choose among plenty of plugins and finally host your website on github pages for free. What is Hexo?Accoding to Hexo’s documentation, Hexo is a fast, simple and powerful blog framework. You write posts in Markdown (or other languages) and Hexo generates static files with a beautiful theme in seconds. -Alright, now let’s dive in. Installing HexoBefore installing hexo, use your OS package manager to update and cleanup system packages. 1$ brew update --all &amp;&amp; brew upgrade --all &amp;&amp; brew cleanup &amp;&amp; brew doctor &amp;&amp; brew prune Install Node.jsHexo is a node.js package. As a result, we first need to install the node.js in case it’s not. 1$ brew install node On linux machines, the procedure is similar with the distro’s package manager. On Windows machines, please refer to this page for download. npm is the default package manager of the node.js. In case you have had the node installed for some time, make an update and clean the previously installed packages. We will later on use npm to install all the required packages in our blog. 1$ npm update &amp;&amp; npm upgrade &amp;&amp; npm cache clean Now, we can actually install the hexo package. 1$ npm install hexo-cli -g Creaing Your First BlogNow, in order to create a blog, goto a directory in which you want to create a blog. 1$ hexo init blog After the blog directory is created cd to the created folder and download all the node modules we need to run and manage our blog. 12$ cd blog$ npm install Running Your Blog serverNow let’s clean (not needed for the first time but it’s a good practice), generate and run the blog on a node server on the default port 4000. 1$ hexo clean &amp;&amp; hexo generate &amp;&amp; hexo server You can now view your blog locally on your browser. Creating Post, Page or DraftIn order to create more posts, you simply need to create .md files within your _posts folder. Additionally, Hexo also provides the following sugar coated commands to create a post, page or draft. 1234$ hexo new \"My Post\"$ hexo new post \"My Post\"$ hexo new page \"About Me\"$ hexo new draft \"My Post\" Now that you have a post, open it in your favorite editor and write your content in markdown language. Having a cheat sheet at your disposal is also a good idea while you are writing in Markdown. At this point you have a working blog (with the default theme). You might want to apply and customize a different theme. Hexo provides a handfule of themes on their website that you can choose from. In addition to themes, plenty of plugins are also available for hexo that can totally enhance your blog and your reader’s experience form it. So, if you still eager about improving your blog and connect a couple of useful plugins, read further on the next section.","categories":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Hexo/"},{"name":"Startup","slug":"Hexo/Startup","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Hexo/Startup/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Tutorials","slug":"Tutorials","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Tutorials/"},{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Hexo/"},{"name":"Blogging","slug":"Blogging","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Blogging/"},{"name":"StaticWebsite","slug":"StaticWebsite","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/StaticWebsite/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Hexo","slug":"Hexo","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Hexo/"},{"name":"Startup","slug":"Hexo/Startup","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Hexo/Startup/"}]},{"title":"Introduction to Akka","slug":"2014/introduction-to-akka","date":"2014-06-12T19:21:34.000Z","updated":"2016-08-31T11:07:35.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/introduction-to-akka/","link":"","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/2014/introduction-to-akka/","excerpt":"The following intends to provide a brief introduction to Akka which is framework based on the actor model and designed to increase the abstraction, scalability and fault-tolerance of systems.

It provides a platform enabling developers to easily create concurrent and loosely coupled applications with the ability of self-healing in the face of failures. Typical Problems of Complex SystemsBelow is mentioned a few of the more important problems and issues that need to be addressed when dealing with more complex systems: Threads tend to need a lot of coordination logic, locks and synchronizations. The amount of threads to be used within an application is limited. It is usually hard to scale up, scale out, deploy and run the complex applications. Creating fault tolerant applications that can recover form errors is tedious. It is cumbersome to modify applications and systems with load balancing. How Akka Addresses the Issues?Alright, now that we know some of the top issues, let’s also mention a few key notes about what Akka has to offer in general and what it brings to the table to address them. Akka pushes the burden of low-level thread management and thread-safe code to the actor model. The use of actor model also makes Akka to be aligned with reactive manifesto which improves applications in the following terms: Message-Driven:Asynchronous message passing decreases coupling and provides location transparency for system components. Resilience:Akka enforces single responsibility through component isolation (actors). Elasticity:As systems scale, they will still be able to handle various workloads. In addition, actors can be increased in amount where they are exactly needed and they also can divide the workload among themselves. Responsiveness:Loose coupling, Resilience and Elasticity will make the system responsive. The increases in abstraction and loose coupling will also result into: Reduction in use of shared states among components. Increase in CPU utilization. Increase in capability to scale up and out. Increasing system fault-tolerance. So, What is an Actor?Definition: an actor is a fundamental primitive unit of computation or work which basically means that they are designed to perform small, simple and well-defined tasks. In order to better imagine and understand what an actor is, let’s start getting to know about their behavior and attributes. Each actor has a unique address and hence location transparent. Each actor has a mailbox (queue of messages), state and behavior. Actors are very lightweight (2.7 Million per 1GB of RAM). They are formed in hierarchies/trees (parent child relationship). They can live and communicate on different machines. They can create child actors. They can heal their children. They can supervise their children. They can change their behavior. They only communicate with one or more actors via message passing. They can only handle one message at a time. They can decide what to do with the message. Their states are only known by querying them (sending messages). Note: The fact that actors come in hierarchies and that they can heal their children can really help developers push the risky and error-prone logic to child actors (or leaves); Therefore, as soon as a child dies, its parent is notified and supervises it accordingly. What is an Actor-System (node)?A node or an actor-system groups several actors and thus, an instance of it can contain one or more actors. According to this definition, we can now have local or remote actors. Let’s say actor “a” lives on actor-system “X”; in this case: Local Actor: An actor “b” is local to actor “a”, if “b” lives on the same actor-system as “a” (meaning actor-system “X”). Remote Actor: An actor “b” is remote to actor “a”, if “b” lives on a different actor-system (let’s say actor-system “Y”). Also note that actor-system “Y” might be located on the same or a separate machine. Using addresses, an actor in one actor-system can send messages to local actor or remote actors. The address of an actor follows the format below and consists of these parts. 1[protocol]://[actor-system]@[hostname]:[port] Details of Actors Actions Creating Actor: With a name and certain properties (called props), actors can create other child actors. Sending Messages: An actor can send message to a local or remote actor. Passing messages among actors are async and non-blocking (Fire &amp; Forget). Actors are totally inactive/passive until they receive a message. Actors can handle throughput of 50 million messages per second per machine. The order of messages are maintained the same for sender and receiver. Changing Behavior: An actor can change its behavior at runtime. This change in behavior is triggered after receiving a message. Supervising Children: Actors can supervise their child actors. Child actors send failure signal and the parent instruct them what to do. The child does not need to know how to handle the error. Actors can supervise their children even over separate physical nodes. There are several error supervising strategies they can pick from. these strategies basically indicate what to do if a child fails in general or of a certain event. The strategy options are: resume / restart / escalate Note: In Akka, the message transport and the message delivery are completely separated processes. Akka uses concurrent-linked-queue as the mailbox, however one can define what message queue to use either per actor or per actor-system (node). Its also possible to use broker and let broker handle messaging. Properties of an Akka MessageAn Akka message is a simple immutable data container defined by user and is created and passed asynchronously among actors. Akka messages also aligned with the definition of a message in reactive manifesto. A message is an item of data that is sent to a specific destination. In a message driven system, addressable recipients await the arrival of messages and react to them, otherwise lying dormant (Reactive Manifesto).","categories":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Akka","slug":"Software-Architecture/Akka","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Akka/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Tutorials","slug":"Tutorials","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Tutorials/"},{"name":"Akka","slug":"Akka","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Akka/"},{"name":"Distributed-Systems","slug":"Distributed-Systems","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Distributed-Systems/"},{"name":"Actor Model","slug":"Actor-Model","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Actor-Model/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Akka","slug":"Software-Architecture/Akka","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Akka/"}]},{"title":"State Pattern","slug":"2013/state","date":"2013-03-29T16:51:03.000Z","updated":"2016-09-06T19:33:48.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2013/state/","link":"","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/2013/state/","excerpt":"Design Patterns Overview DefinitionChange the Behavior According to the State.

RecipeBefore identifying the elements for flyweight pattern, consider the following definitions: Intrinsic State: A state in the object upon which we will keep a reference of that object (share the object). Extrinsic State: Other states of the object that are not important to your activity at all. 123456789interface IProduct &#123;&#125;class Product implements IProduct &#123; Object intrinsicState; /* extrinsic states... */ Product(Object intrinsicState) &#123; this.intrinsicState = intrinsicState; &#125;&#125; The factory where limited objects are kept and can be fetched by their intrinsic state. 123456789class ProductFactory &#123; static HashMap&lt;Object, IProduct&gt; products = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); static IProduct create(Object intrinsicState) &#123; if (!products.containsKey(intrinsicState)) products.put(intrinsicState, new Product(intrinsicState)); return products.get(intrinsicState); &#125;&#125; ServeThe client uses the factory to either create or fetch previously created product. The client can change any extrinsic states of the same instance of the fetched product and use it as suited. 12345678910class Client &#123; List&lt;IProduct&gt; products = new Vector&lt;&gt;(); Client() &#123; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; i++) &#123; Object intrinsicState = getFromLimitedIntrinsicStates(); products.add(ProductFactory.create(intrinsicState)); &#125; &#125;&#125; Important BenefitsThis pattern reduces the amount of memory consumption by sharing the objects that are similar in some way rather than creating new ones. ExampleA governmental application shall be put to smoke test for it’s limitations while processing massive amount of data. Your task is to create an in-memory database (Collections) with many records to make the test closer to reality. This collection does not need to contain unique items as long as it contains many of them. Imagine this in-memory database table called ‘JobsTable’ that needs to be populated with at least around 100,000 ‘Job’ object. Let’s first define the notion of ‘Job’ and ‘MockJob’. Notice that job title is the Job’s intrinsic state of the ‘Job’. 123456789101112interface IJob &#123;&#125;class MockJob implements IJob &#123; String title; double salary; String risk; MockJob(String title) &#123; this.title = title; salary = 1000d; risk = \"LOW\"; &#125;&#125; The ‘JobFactory’ stores jobs based on their title.

So What’s the Difference? The difference lies in when the pattern is about to be applied. The adapter create adaptability between an already existing ‘Product’ and ‘Adaptee’ over which one might not have any control (say a third-party library, or legacy code). The bridge pattern however, creates such adaptability up front; prior to classes being created or designed. In above implementation, developers might come up with more ‘IProduct’ implementations or more subclasses of ‘ProductA’ and ‘ProductB’ while rest assured that eventually methods will hook properly. Important Benefits Progressively adding functionality while separating out major differences using abstract classes. Helps when both abstractions and concrete classes are to be changed frequently and independently. ExampleImagine we’re designing graphics API to render form-components (Buttons, TextBoxes, Comboboxes and etc) on graphics containers such as web pages or application canvas. For now, let’s say that: We need to present Buttons, TextBoxes and ComboBoxes to render on webpage or canvas. They come in either light or dark themes. It’s not known how many components or themes are to be added in future. As a result, normally we might end up with classes below; while each has its own ‘render()’ implementation: Button ButtonDark ButtonLight TextBox TextBoxLight TextBoxDark ComboBox ComboBoxDark ComboBoxLight This approach, however has a drawback. What if we need to add a Checkbox? then we need to define the checkbox top class with two additional dark and light flavor. What if we need to add one more theme? then we need to add three more classes for each component. Not Very Optimal… Right?Applying the bridge pattern, let’s decouple the concept of ‘Theme’ from ‘GUI-Container’. 12345678910111213interface ITheme &#123; Object[] elements();&#125;class DarkTheme implements ITheme &#123; Object[] elements() &#123; // return dark graphics &#125;&#125;class LightTheme implements ITheme &#123; Object[] elements() &#123; // return light graphics &#125;&#125; Accordingly, the graphics containers will look like this: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243abstract class GuiContainer &#123; ITheme theme; GuiContainer(ITheme theme) &#123; this.theme = theme; &#125; abstract void drawComboBox(); abstract void drawButton(); abstract void drawTextBox();&#125;class Website extends GuiContainer &#123; ITheme theme; Website(ITheme theme) &#123; super(theme); &#125; void drawComboBox() &#123; Object[] elements = theme.elements(); // get combobox graphics &amp; render on a webpage &#125; void drawButton() &#123; Object[] elements = theme.elements(); // get button graphics &amp; render on a webpage &#125; void drawTextBox() &#123; Object[] elements = theme.elements(); // get textbox graphics &amp; render on a webpage &#125;&#125;class Application extends GuiContainer &#123; ITheme theme; Application(ITheme theme) &#123; super(theme); &#125; void drawComboBox() &#123; Object[] elements = theme.elements(); // get combobox graphics &amp; render on a canvas &#125; void drawButton() &#123; Object[] elements = theme.elements(); // get button graphics &amp; render on a canvas &#125; void drawTextBox() &#123; Object[] elements = theme.elements(); // get textbox graphics &amp; render on a canvas &#125;&#125; Notice: ‘Theme’ and ‘GuiContainer’ are completely independent entities. Also, each GUI container only needs one theme at the same time and not more. 123456789class Client &#123; Client() &#123; ITheme darkTheme = new DarkTheme(); Website website = new Website(darkTheme); website.drawButton(); website.drawComboBox(); website.drawTextBox(); &#125;&#125; Alright, let’s answer the same questions now. What if we need to add a Checkbox? then we need to implement the logic for how to render it on both webpage and canvas. What if we need to add one more theme? then we need to return elements of that theme.

Two methods to update and also sign out the owner of it. 1234interface IModernProfile &#123; void update(Object[] props); void signOut();&#125; The legacy profile, like it or not, has much more granular methods and behaviors. 12345678class LegacyProfile &#123; void closeCurrentSession() &#123;/* implementation */&#125; void closeDatabaseConnections() &#123;/* implementation */&#125; void setUsername(String username) &#123;/* implementation */&#125; void setFullName(String fullName) &#123;/* implementation */&#125; void setUserAge(int age) &#123;/* implementation */&#125; void setUserAddress(String address) &#123;/* implementation */&#125;&#125; Since we cannot change its source code directly, we can write an adapter that implements the new profile interface and accepts an instance of the old one. Notice that the adapter will map actions between the adapter and the adaptee. 12345678910111213141516class ModernProfileAdapter implements IModernProfile &#123; LegacyProfile legacyProfile; ModernProfileAdapter(LegacyProfile legacyProfile) &#123; this.legacyProfile = legacyProfile; &#125; void update(Object[] props) &#123; legacyProfile.setUsername(props[0].toString()); legacyProfile.setFullName(props[1].toString()); legacyProfile.setUserAge(toInt(props[2])); legacyProfile.setUserAddress(props[3].toString()); &#125; void signOut() &#123; legacyProfile.closeDatabaseConnections(); legacyProfile.closeCurrentSession(); &#125;&#125; Finally, we’re now able to use the legacy profile as if it’s a modern profile. 123456789101112class Client &#123; Client() &#123; ModernProfileAdapter profileAdapter = new ModernProfileAdapter(new LegacyProfile()); profileAdapter.update (new Object[] &#123; \"john12\", \"John Doe\", 33, \"1234 XYZ Street\" &#125;); profileAdapter.signOut(); &#125;&#125; Design Patterns Overview","categories":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Design Patterns","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Types","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/"},{"name":"Structural","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Design-Patterns","slug":"Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Tutorials","slug":"Tutorials","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Tutorials/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Design Patterns","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Types","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/"},{"name":"Structural","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural/"}]},{"title":"Decorator Pattern","slug":"2011/decorator","date":"2011-09-24T09:27:03.000Z","updated":"2016-09-06T13:31:37.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2011/decorator/","link":"","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/2011/decorator/","excerpt":"Design Patterns Overview DefinitionProvide New Abilities/Behaviors at Runtime.

ExampleSuppose that we are about to create a logger that logs text messages to file. So, the basic logger only appends given strings to a file. However, many of our developer users also demanded us to equip the logs with the current timestamp. Our test department users also requested the logs to be colorful, since they open the logs with an enhanced text editor and they want errors and warning to stand out. Accordingly, the product would be a ‘Logger’ as defined below. 123456interface ILogger &#123; void log(String message);&#125;class Logger implements ILogger &#123; void log(String message) &#123;/* log to file */&#125;&#125; Based on the demands, instead of modifying the base logger, we could introduce two decorators to improve the base logger. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829class Decorator implements ILogger &#123; ILogger logger; Decorator(ILogger logger) &#123; this.logger = logger; &#125; void log(String message) &#123; logger.log(message); &#125;&#125;class TimeDecorator extends Decorator &#123; TimeDecorator(ILogger logger) &#123; super(logger); &#125; void log(String message) &#123; String timestamp = \"&lt;formatted-timestamp-of-current-moment&gt;\"; String timestampedMessage = String.format(\"Timestamp %s: %s\", timestamp, message); super.log(timestampedMessage); &#125;&#125;class ColorDecorator extends Decorator &#123; ColorDecorator(ILogger logger) &#123; super(logger); &#125; void log(String message) &#123; super.log(toColored(message)); &#125; void toColored(String message) &#123; String template = \"&lt;font color=\\\"%s\\\"&gt;%s&lt;/font&gt;\"; if (message.startsWith(\"Error\")) return String.format(template, \"red\", message); if (message.startsWith(\"Warning\")) return String.format(template, \"yellow\", message); return String.format(template, \"green\" message); &#125;&#125; Now, the client is able to equip the base logger with any amount of decorators and use it. 123456789101112class Client &#123; Client() &#123; Logger simpleLogger = new Logger(); ColorDecorator colorLogger = new ColorDecorator(simpleLogger); ILogger timedColorLogger = new TimeDecorator(colorLogger); timedColorLogger.log(\"Error: invalid id\"); timedColorLogger.log(\"Warning: address not defined\"); simpleLogger.log(\"application started\"); &#125;&#125; Design Patterns Overview","categories":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Design Patterns","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Types","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/"},{"name":"Structural","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Design-Patterns","slug":"Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Tutorials","slug":"Tutorials","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Tutorials/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Design Patterns","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Types","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/"},{"name":"Structural","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural/"}]},{"title":"Command Pattern","slug":"2011/command","date":"2011-07-16T08:14:47.000Z","updated":"2016-09-06T13:31:25.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2011/command/","link":"","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/2011/command/","excerpt":"Design Patterns Overview DefinitionCreate a Set of Reusable Commands For Various Products.

The snippet below presents one of the simplest thread-safe approaches that is not too complicated to confuse you and also not too simple to ignore the complexities it might require in real implementation. A class with a private constructor and a private instance of itself that can be assigned only once. 1234567891011121314151617class Singleton &#123; private static Singleton singleton; // constructor private Singleton() &#123; &#125; static Singleton getInstance() &#123; if (singleton != null) return singleton; synchronized (Singleton.class) &#123; if (singleton == null) &#123; singleton = new Singleton(); &#125; &#125; return singleton; &#125; void operation() &#123;/*do sth.*/&#125;&#125; ServeAfter defining the singleton, all other classes can only access the very same instance of it across the virtual machine (JVM) as shown below. 123456class Client &#123; Client() &#123; Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance(); singleton.operation(); &#125;&#125; Important BenefitsDisadvantages of singletons are far more than their benefits. They reduce testability in great deal and introduce unnecessary coupling throughout the system. A singleton can yield best results in a situation where various parts of an application concurrently try to access a shared resource. An example of a shared resource would be Logger, Print Spooler, etc.In general, the use of singletons are only encouraged through the dependency injection.

Choose a Factory at Runtime, in Order to Create Different Objects of a Certain Category. Recipe Definition of the products. In our case, 4 products: product Type A (comes in A1 &amp; A2 Flavors) product Type B (comes in B1 &amp; B2 Flavors) 123456789/* Product A Flavors */interface IProductA &#123; &#125;class ProductA1 implements IProductA &#123; &#125;class ProductA2 implements IProductA &#123; &#125;/* Product B Flavors */interface IProductB &#123; &#125;class ProductB1 implements IProductB &#123; &#125;class ProductB2 implements IProductB &#123; &#125; The family of factories. Notice that when ‘Factory2’ wants to create a product of type ‘A’, it returns ‘A1’ (and not ‘A2’) and this basically tries to emphasize that it is possible to build our factories in a way to return various flavors of available products according to the software needs. 12345678910111213interface IFactory &#123; IProductA createA(); IProductB createB();&#125;class Factory1 implements IFactory &#123; IProductA createA() &#123; return new ProductA1(); &#125; IProductB createB() &#123; return new ProductB1(); &#125;&#125;class Factory2 implements IFactory &#123; IProductA createA() &#123; return new ProductA1(); &#125; IProductB createB() &#123; return new ProductB2(); &#125;&#125; Now that we have the factories, let’s have simple static method that chooses a factory for us at runtime to create the right product. The ‘Props’ is an arbitrary object that contains some properties on which the selection is based. 12345678class FactorySelector &#123; static IFactory selectBy(Props props) &#123; if(/*shall select factory1?*/) return new Factory1(); if(/*shall select factory2?*/) return new Factory2(); &#125;&#125; ServeIf you have everything ready, then it would be only a matter of asking ‘FactorySelector’ to choose the right factory and create the desired product. 123456class Client &#123; Client() &#123; IFactory factory = FactorySelector.selectBy(props); IProductB product = factory.createB(); &#125;&#125; Important Benefits It basically has advantages similar to the factory pattern. ExampleLet’s say that we want to print some messages. The printer object can be designed to print messages to file, console, paper and etc. Messages can also come in different formats such as unstructured text, xml, json and etc. As a result, the product hierarchy is define as following. 12345678910111213141516171819interface IPrinter &#123; void print(String message);&#125;class ConsolePrinter implements IPrinter &#123; void print(String message) &#123;/*to console*/&#125;&#125;class FilePrinter implements IPrinter &#123; void print(String message) &#123;/*to file*/&#125;&#125;interface IParser &#123; String parse(String message);&#125;class JsonParser implements IParser &#123; String parse(String message) &#123; /*parse json*/ &#125;&#125;class XmlParser implements IParser &#123; String parse(String message) &#123; /*parse xml*/ &#125;&#125; Two different factories are defined here: ‘Logger’ which logs json messages to file ‘Display’ which shows xml messages in console 1234567891011121314151617181920212223interface IFactory &#123; IPrinter createPrinter(); IParser createParser(); void printMessage(String message);&#125;abstract class AbstractFactory implements IFactory &#123; void printMessage(String message) &#123; IPrinter printer = createPrinter(); IParser parser = createParser(); printer.print(parser.parse(message)); &#125;&#125;class Logger extends AbstractFactory &#123; IPrinter createPrinter() &#123; return new FilePrinter(); &#125; IParser createParser() &#123; return new JsonParser(); &#125;&#125;class Display extends AbstractFactory &#123; IPrinter createPrinter() &#123; return new ConsolePrinter(); &#125; IParser createParser() &#123; return new XmlParser(); &#125;&#125; Our ‘FactorySelector’ chooses the proper factory based on a given string. 12345678class FactorySelector &#123; static IFactory select(String type) &#123; if(type.equals(\"display\")) return new Display(); if(type.equals(\"logger\")) return new Logger(); &#125;&#125; And finally, the client code can use factories as demonstrated. 12345678910111213141516class Client &#123; IFactory factory; Client() &#123; factory = FactorySelector.select(\"logger\"); factory.printMessage(\"&#123; \\\"hello\\\" : \\\"world\\\" &#125;\"); writeOutput(\"writing to file...\"); factory = FactorySelector.select(\"display\"); writeOutput(\"writing to console\"); &#125; void writeOutput(String message) &#123; factory.createPrinter().print(message); &#125;&#125; Design Patterns Overview","categories":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Design Patterns","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Types","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/"},{"name":"Creational","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Creational","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Creational/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Design-Patterns","slug":"Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Tutorials","slug":"Tutorials","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Tutorials/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Design Patterns","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Types","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/"},{"name":"Creational","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Creational","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Creational/"}]},{"title":"Facade Pattern","slug":"2010/factory","date":"2010-11-25T22:10:55.000Z","updated":"2016-09-06T13:28:29.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/factory/","link":"","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/2010/factory/","excerpt":"Design Patterns Overview DefinitionHaving Decisions of object creation to be made at Runtime.

Making it easier to modify the object creation logic. The client knows what types of classes are possible to build. ExampleSuppose that we want to send a message from one computer to another. This can be done in various ways such as sending via TCP, email, web services and etc. In such case, let’s call them devices as defined in ‘Device’ class. 12345678910interface IDevice &#123; void send(String message);&#125;class TcpDevice implements IDevice &#123; void send(String message) &#123;/*TCP impl.*/&#125;&#125;class MailDevice implements IDevice &#123; void send(String message) &#123;/*Mail Impl.*/&#125;&#125; We also have a messenger that uses a Device to send a message. Note that the derivations return the type of device they need for messaging. 123456789101112131415161718abstract class Messenger &#123; send(String message) &#123; IDevice Device = createDevice(); Device.send(message); &#125; abstract IDevice createDevice();&#125;class TcpMessenger extends Messenger &#123; IDevice createDevice() &#123; return new TcpDevice(); &#125;&#125;class MailMessenger extends Messenger &#123; IDevice createDevice() &#123; return new MailDevice(); &#125;&#125; Now, if the client needs to send a TCP message, it only needs to create a ‘TcpMessenger’ and the creation will be taken care of. 123456class Client &#123; Client() &#123; Messenger tcpMessenger = new TcpMessenger(); tcpMessenger.send(\"hello world!\"); &#125;&#125; Design Patterns Overview","categories":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Design Patterns","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Types","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/"},{"name":"Structural","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Design-Patterns","slug":"Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Tutorials","slug":"Tutorials","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Tutorials/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Design Patterns","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Types","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/"},{"name":"Structural","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Types/Structural/"}]},{"title":"Observer Pattern","slug":"2010/observer","date":"2010-10-18T19:11:19.000Z","updated":"2016-09-06T13:30:19.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/observer/","link":"","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/2010/observer/","excerpt":"Design Patterns Overview DefinitionReceive topic updates from publisher by subscribing to them.

All the examples and UML diagrams do help understanding the pattern, but deep down, developers are far better at reading code; specially code snippets. This became the very reason for me to start describing patterns in an easier manner and friendlier format. In a way that I was expected to be explained when I began. Each pattern are described in 5 sections: Definition: One or two sentence to describe the essence of the pattern. Recipe: Introducing the basic elements and the nuts and bolts of a pattern. Serve: Putting it all together to see how the pattern is served to the client code. Benefits: Mentioning some few important benefits of the pattern. Example: Giving a trivial concrete example to help reader remember the pattern. A section like ‘When to Use’ is intentionally ignored since I believe if developers understand the pattern thoroughly, then they will realize which one to use when they encounter a problem. What is a Design PatternI believe the Wikipedia‘s definition of design pattern is quite clear. It basically states that a design pattern is a general solution to problems that we developers usually encounter on daily basis while adding new features or refactoring code. They are not finished solution for specific problems nor they can be transformed directly into source code. Design Patterns ClassificationClassical Design Patterns are essentially divided in 3 categories. Each category addresses problems in a specific much wider area of software development. Behavioral PatternsBehavioral patterns are those that concern the different aspects of the behaviors that your entities might take on. These patterns help your design to be more resilient to change specifically when the change concerns the communication between objects. Strategy Change a Product’s Behavior at Runtime Observer Be Notified When Something Happens Command Create a Set of Reusable Commands For Various Products State Change the Behavior According to the State Template Method Create a Fixed Procedure and Vary Its Details in Subclasses Visitor Interpreter Chain of Responsibility Iterator Get the Iterator for Any Type of Collections in Subclasses Mediator Memento Creational PatternsCreational patterns are ones that create objects for you, rather than having you instantiate objects directly. This gives your program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case (Wikipedia). Factory Method Create Objects Without Knowing Their Specific Type Abstract Factory Group Factories of Similar Products Singleton Making Only One Object of a Class to Be Available for All Prototype Create New Objects by Cloning Builder Simplify Creation of Objects With Many Properties Structural PatternsThese patterns concern class and object composition. They use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality (Wikipedia) Adapter Create Adaptability Among Different Interfaces Decorator Provide New Abilities/Behaviors at Runtime Composite Add the Capability of Never Ending Grouping Bridge Decouple Products from Their Usage To Allow Independent Changes Facade Provide a Simplified Interface to a Set of Classes Flyweight Improve Performance by Sharing Objects Instead of Creating Them Proxy Limit Access to a Sensitive Properties and Behaviors of a Class","categories":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Design Patterns","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Overview","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Overview","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Overview/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Design-Patterns","slug":"Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Tutorials","slug":"Tutorials","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/tags/Tutorials/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"Software Architecture","slug":"Software-Architecture","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/"},{"name":"Design Patterns","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/"},{"name":"Overview","slug":"Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Overview","permalink":"http://truelogician.com/categories/Software-Architecture/Design-Patterns/Overview/"}]}]}
